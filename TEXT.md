About Me

Im a musician with an education in the arts, having studied Visual Communication and Photography at Regents College, London. Years spent working with digital recording technology gave me an interest in software, which led me to web development.

Python/Flask/Django, Javascript/GSAP animation library, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, Photoshop/Affinity

Goat Daisy

A full stack project built in Django. Fictional antique shop that does specialised repairs, involving the customer closely in the process. Integrating Stripe payments (CC, bank transfers, local providers like iDeal etc) and a custom payment webhook flow, the site has unique CMS sections for different staff permissions groups. Bootstrap, AWS S3 buckets, deployed on Heroku.

Money Manager

An app built using Flask/Werkzeug. Takes in details of your financial activity and keeps track of desired savings amounts, taxes to set aside and specifics related to tax seasons. Features variable tax rate by location, secure user accounts and (my favourite) light vs dark mode.

Projects

Front end design and static build projects for fun/friends/pocket money.

Setts - Handmade Swedish workwear.

Haarlem Bij Nacht - Art project funded by the city of Haarlem

35smile - My static sidebusiness project

This portfolio site was built using HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap), GSAP js library (including the lovely Scroll Trigger module)

More about me

I think people skills and relationships are most important. I have had a lot of experience managing difficult creative projects with complex personalities. I have found this experience in the music industry has served me very well in so many other fields, as it always seems to come back to human relationships.

I am a singer, songwriter, baker and a cook. I volunteer two days a week at a hospice. I am of mixed Arab-European heritage and live in the Netherlands.
